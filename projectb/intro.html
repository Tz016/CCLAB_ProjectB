			The inspiration is from Mulvey's <em><a id="textname"
					href="https://www.google.com/search?q=visual+pleasure+and+narrative+cinema&oq=Visual+Pleasure+and+Narrative+Cinema&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i512j46i512j69i59j0i512l3j69i60l2.844j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">"Visual

		<p id="text">
			In this text, Mulvey uses the psychoanalytic method to analyze how women and men characters in narrative
			films bring the audience visual pleasure. She argues that female characters are the erotic object of the
			gaze of the audience and the male characters. <br> <br>Due to the penis envy and castration anxiety
			constructed in our patriarchal society, female characters can only take preoccupation with the re-enactment
			of the original trauma and be objectified as a perfect product. The audience get pleasure from the female
			characters through the fetish scopophilia. <br><br>While the audience mirror themselves onto the male
			protagonists, seeing the male characters as a “more perfect, complete, more powerful ideal ego conceived in
			the original moment of recognition in front of the mirror. The character in the story can make things happen
			and control events better than the subject/spectator, just as the image in the mirror was more in control of
			motor co-ordination” (20).

		<p id="my_work">
			In the Workpage, when the user says something, the page will convert the speech to text which will be shown on the screen in real-time, and then the page will say these words again in a system-generated female voice. I hope to use the text and the repeated words to create a sense of “mirroring your own speech”, which may be related to the audience mirroring themselves onto male characters in films.  But the system-generated female voice, which we are extremely familiar with due to the use in Siri and other AI, tends to be seen as very service-oriented. This is thoroughly opposed to the perfect, powerful, active role of male characters in films and is more similar to representative female roles in films (according to the “Visual Pleasure” this text). The aim is to make users feel weird and attracted to the patriarchal phenomenon analyzed in Mulvey’s text.
<br><br>Because most people don’t know the text “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema”, the first page is to introduce the text material I use. On this page, I put my understanding of the text, my inspiration process, and my project abstract. To help users explore the topic more, I also link some relative terms and add a resource box at the right of the page.

		<h3 id="work_topic">Inspiration Process</h3>
		<p id="inspire">
			Once in the class (where this reading is class material and we were asked to write something about the male
			gaze), a classmate asked that could she not use the visual material. The professor just turned the question
			back that if she could combine the gaze with audio material then of course she could not use the visual
			work. At that time I just thought it was impossible to combine gaze and visual pleasure with audio material.
			<br><br>However, when I started to work on this CCLab project, facing a page to which I had already imported
			a library which can real-time convert users’ words to text, those words just came to my mind. I found that I
			would be delighted when I saw my words converted to string on the screen, so I guessed the reason for this
			feeling perhaps was related to how people mirror themselves onto male characters to some extent – I mirrored
			my audio to the text on the screen.
